    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large sweet potato</li>
        <li>1 Tbs canola oil</li>
        <li>1/4 sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potato into 1/16-inch-thick rounds using a mandoline. <br>
            Put potato slices in a large bowl of cold water; 
            soak about 20 minutes.<br>
            Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Wipe out bowl.</li>
        <li>Return potato slices to dried bowl. Add oil, salt, and pepper;<br>
             toss gently to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly golden and crispy, 12 to 16 minutes, 
            turning and rearranging chips into an even layer every 4 minutes. <br>
            Watch closely during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking. <br>
            Check chips about every 30 seconds, 
            using tongs to remove golden chips from the basket as needed to 
            avoid overcooking and ending up with bitter chips.</li>
        <li>Let chips cool about 5 minutes. Chips will continue to crisp as they cool.<br>
            Store in an airtight container up to 3 days.</li>
     </ol>
